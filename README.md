# AFTER EFFECTS SCRIPT COLLECTION

## Overview

This repository contains Adobe After Effects scripts which I created in order to make my editing life easier. In video editing, lots of the time you are doing very repititive tasks and so with my scripts I plan to help make everything faster and smoother.


## Included Scripts

### SIMPLE LAYERS

Tools for quickly creating and managing:

* Null layers
* Adjustment layers
* Solid layers
* One-frame adjustment and solid layers

## Installation

Each script inside this repository includes its own folder and can be installed independently.

To install any script:

1. Download the `.jsx` file for that script.
2. Place it inside your After Effects Scripts UI Panels directory:

**macOS:**
`/Applications/Adobe After Effects [version]/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels/`

**Windows:**
`C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects [version]\Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels\`

3. Restart After Effects.
4. Open the panel from:
**Window → [Script Name]**

Also at the end of my scripts or even in the code 
you may see text saying "Made by Dursc". 
"Dursc" is just my alias in the editing community 
so I chose to add that for any recognition when 
I share these scripts.
